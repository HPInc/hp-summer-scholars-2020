    "\n",
    "There's a few things to note about the data set we just created that make it less than ideal for a real-world situation:\n",
    "- Each state can have one and only one salesperson\n",
    "- If a salesperson were to handle two states, you'd have to duplicate their name (not normalized)\n",
    "- Our primary key constraint is on the 'state' column, which would not allow more than one record per state\n",
    "- We only have the name of the salesperson, no details (e.g. e-mail address)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dataset is OK for the faked-up example we're doing here, it's important to think about how your data will be used by others.  In this case, the dataset is pretty limiting, and it probably means that you'd have to do a bunch of rework later on if something changed (e.g. to allow a backup salesperson per state).  Sometimes you can make a small change to the dataset at the beginning that makes it a lot easier.  Examples in this case:\n",
    "- Adding an integer ID field as the primary key instead, allowing multiple state records\n",
    "- A separate table for salesperson details, including name, e-mail, phone, etc. with an integer ID as the primary key\n",
    "- Instead of putting the salesperson name, use the salesperson detail ID to normalize this table\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing a little work up front can make it much easier to share data across your organization.  The changes above would make the data set more resilient to reasonable changes without having to do a bunch of schema changes that would break downstream apps, reports, or dashboards.\n",
