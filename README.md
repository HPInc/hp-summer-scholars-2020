# Holistic View of Data to Drive Business Decisions

This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks and supporting materials for the
session on data and business insights.  See the slides here: [data-to-business-insights.pdf](presentation/data-to-business-insights.pdf). 

## Session Description

Data has rapidly become one of the most critical elements driving business strategy.  At HP, we believe that creating,
 ingesting, securing, maintaining privacy, sharing and efficiently processing the data we collect and produce is the
  basis for innovating in our business.  The value of that data is realized when we make business decisions in
   the customers’ best interest.  How we govern data using policies, data sourcing, data operations, data hygiene,
    and analytics are critical  We’ll include some short demos for some of the steps along the way, like data 
    cleansing and aggregation, and talk about the importance of taking a holistic view and keep the data in context.

# Setup for the Notebooks

The code  and notes for this course are contained in a set of Python-based Jupyter notebooks, and we ue PostgreSQL as the database for the analysis.
If you'd like to run it yourself, you'll need a few things installed.

## Install Anaconda

The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) platform is a really easy way to get a Python 3 distribution and Jupyter
all in one package.  Install the [individual edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your
machine.

## Install PostgreSQL

Install Postgres from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

Add a role called 'sales' with a password; you'll use it in Notebook 1.

# How to Use the Notebooks

- From your Anaconda install, launch 'Jupyter Notebook'.  The Jupyter UI will launch in your browser.
- Navigate to the ```jupyter-notebooks``` folder of this repo and open ```0. Introduction.ipynb```
- To run all code in the notebook, do ```Cell - Run All``` from the top menu.  This will run each cell in sequence.
- Read the comments and see the output from each step.
